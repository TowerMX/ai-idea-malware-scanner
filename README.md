# Malware scanner using AI techniques

Building AI course project - My IA idea

## Summary

My idea is to use the knowledge earned throughout the [Building AI](https://buildingai.elementsofai.com/) course by Reaktor and apply as much as I can to a real world problem â€” detecting malware in a downloaded file to help prevent an infection, or scan a whole unit in a short time.


## Background

Virus infections happen everyday. And when a pc has malware in it, if you scan the whole disk it can take a lot of time.
In my personal experience, I wasn't even infected but even so I wanted to make a full scan since I had never done one in a long time. The large amount of files in my PC took 7 hours for it to finish, and I thought I could use what I learned in the course to shorten the wait!


## How is it used?

The basic funcioning I came up with is to build a convolutional neural network with data of existing virus and random safe files, therefore we can apply filters to the files we would like to scan and check if there is a potential risk on it checking for certain code sentences. The great benefit of using this type of neural networks is that we can apply those filters to parts of the files, not having to consider as many parameters as characters of code!
The final release of the program would be an antivirus everyone could install on their computers.


## Data sources and AI methods

The infected files data would be collected by others, and for the safe files everyone could submit samples if it was an open-source project


## Challenges

The main problems this approach encounter are:

* It can only detect malware that already exists and we have made a model with
* The database will need to be updated whenever new malware info is obtained, therefore for every release we would have to build a different model which could potentially take a long time to make
* It might not be trivial to obtain data, and even if it was, we would need a lot of safe malware-free files and permission to use all of them
* If everyone can upload safe files, how can we make sure it has no malware in them? If we need data to create the model, but we need the model to check whether the data is correct, that's not a trustworthy method


## What next?

To detect new malware, we may use the same methods antivirus companies apply nowadays.
It would be great if we could update a model to adapt to extra training data without having to create a new one, that could solve the second challenge mentioned before.
We still need a reliable data source to create the model.

Further research is required!
